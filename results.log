No offset:
    Points used: 100
    In meters: 34.33 error, 13.00 stddev
    In pixels: 11.70 error, 4.42 stddev
Unscaled offset:
    Points used: 100
    In meters: 114.43 error, 72.42 stddev
    In pixels: 38.95 error, 24.65 stddev
Scaled offset:
    Points used: 100
    In meters: 33.13 error, 7.13 stddev
    In pixels: 11.29 error, 2.43 stddev

With scaled offset, the error is generally in a single direction (both axes)
The values of the calculated/predicted pixel is generally larger than
the actual pixel value.
